predeclared types
bool
int8/uint8, int16/uint16, int32/uint32, int64/uint64, byte(uint8), rune(int32), int, uint,
float32, float64, complex64, complex128
string

type literals
array, struct, pointer, function, slice, map, channel, interface


type(
	alias = type
	typeName type
)

alias is just another name for the existing type
typeName creates a new type with the same underlying type as the type referred

former is type alias, latter is type definition

type definition and predeclared types are called named types, if type alias refers to a named type it is also named
type literals are unnamed types

---------------------------------------------------------------------
All types have an underlying type. 
The underlying type of predeclared types and type literals are the types themselves.
The underlying type of a type definition is the underlying type of the type it is referring to or if it is referring to 
a type literal, then the underlying type is the literal itself.

Each Named type has a unique identity. unnamed types are identical if they are structurally identical.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Type conversion (Implicit and explicit)
Implicit conversion is done through assignment, explicit is of the form T(x), where T is the type and x is the value

Rules:
* All types that are identical can be implicitly converted
ex: int <-> int, uint8 <-> byte, []byte <-> []uint8, *int <-> *int 

* if types share the same underlying type, they can be explicitly converted
ex:
	type MyInt int

	var a MyInt	// a is a value of named type
	var b int	// b is a value of named type
	
	the underlying type of MyInt and int are the same i.e int, so the values can be explicitly converted

	a = MyInt(b) 
	b = int(a)

* if types share the same underlying type and one of them is an unnamed type they can be implicitly converted
ex: 
	type IntPtr *int 
	
	var a IntPtr 	// a is a value of Named type 
	var b *int 	// b is a value of unnamed type {type literal}
	
	since the underlying type of both are the same, they can be implicitly converted.
	
	a = b	 
	b = a

* Pointer specific rule - if types dont share the same underlying type, but both of them are unnamed pointers whose base have the 
same underlying type, then they can be explicitly converted.
In Go, an unnamed pointer type can be represented with *T , where T can be an arbitrary type. Type T is called the base type of pointer type *T .
We can declare named pointer types, but generally, it's not recommended to use named pointer types, for unnamed pointer types have better readabilities.
ex:
	type MyInt int

	var a *MyInt 	// a is value of unnamed pointer type	(*MyInt makes it unnamed)
	var b *int 	// b is value of unnamed pointer type

	the base of *MyInt is MyInt and *int is int, but their underlying types is int, so

	a = (*MyInt)(*int)
	b = (*int)(*MyInt)


* Interface rule - A value v with type T that implements interface I, then value can be implicitly converted to I

* strings
	- A string value can be explicitly converted to a slice type whose underlying type is []byte (a.k.a., []uint8), and vice versa.
	- A string value can be explicitly converted to a slice type whose underlying type is []rune (a.k.a., []int32), and	vice versa
	- If the type (or default type) of a value is an integer type, then the value can be explicitly converted to string types.

* slices - slice may be converted to an array. if the length of the array type is larger than the length of the slice, a panic occurs.
	
* functions
	import "fmt"

	type Greeting func(name string) string

	func (g Greeting) exclamation(name string) string {
		return g(name) + "!"
	
	func english(name string) string { return "Hello, " + name }

	func main() {
		fmt.Println(emglish("Alisus"))
		fmt.Println(Greeting(english).exclamation("Alisus"))

			or

		var g Greeting
		g = english
		fmt.Println(g("Alisus"))

	}

Examples
--------
1) 
package main

func main() {
	type IntSlice []int
	type MySlice []int

	var is = IntSlice{}
	var ms = MySlice{}

	is = IntSlice(ms)
	ms = MySlice(is)

	type Foo = struct {
		n int `name:"foo"`
	}
	type Bar = struct {
		n int `name:"bar"`
	}

	var x map[Foo]Bar
	var y map[Bar]Foo

	x = map[Foo]Bar(y)
	y = map[Bar]Foo(x)

	var s = []int{}

	s = is
	s = ms
	is = s
	ms = s

}

2) Pointer related

package main

func main() {
	type MyInt int
	type IntPtr *int
	type MyIntPtr *MyInt

	var pi = new(int)

	var ip IntPtr = pi

	// var _ *MyInt = pi
	var _ *MyInt = (*MyInt)(pi)

	//
	// var _ MyIntPtr = pi
	// var _ = MyIntPtr(pi)
	var _ MyIntPtr = (*MyInt)(pi)
	var _ = MyIntPtr((*MyInt)(pi))

	//
	// var _ MyIntPtr = ip
	// var _  = MyIntPtr(ip)
	var _ MyIntPtr = (*MyInt)((*int)(ip))
	var _ = MyIntPtr((*MyInt)((*int)(ip)))

}

3) Channel specific rule - bidirectional channel can be converted implicitly to another channel (bidirectional/non-bidirectional),
if they have same element type and either one is an unnamed type. 


package main

func main() {
	type C chan string
	type C1 chan<- string
	type C2 <-chan string

	var ca C
	var cb chan string

	ca = cb
	cb = ca

	var _, _ chan<- string = ca, cb
	var _, _ <-chan string = ca, cb
	var _ C1 = cb
	var _ C2 = cb

	// Can't be converted directly
	//
	// var _ = C1(ca)
	// var _ = C2(ca)
	//

	var _ C1 = (chan<- string)(ca)
	var _ C2 = (<-chan string)(ca)

	var _ = C1((chan<- string)(ca))
	var _ = C2((<-chan string)(ca))

}

4) Untyped conversion - An untyped value can be implicitly converted to type T, if the untyped value can be representable as value of type T.


package main

func main() {
	var _ []int = nil
	var _ map[string]int = nil
	var _ chan string = nil
	var _ func()() = nil
	var _ *bool = nil
	var _ interface{} = nil

	var _ int = 123.0				
	var _ float64 = 123
	var _ int32 = 1.23e2
	var _ int8 = 1 + 0i
}

5) constants 
	- If x is an untyped constant representable by a value of type T, then x can be implicitly converted 
	- If x is a typed constant representable as a value of type T, then x can be explicitly converted to T

package main

func main() {
	// The implicit conversions are all legal.
	const I = 123						// I is an untyped constant, whose default type is int
	const I1, I2 int8 = 0x7F, -0x80				// I1, I2 are typed constants 
	const I3, I4 int8 = I, 0.0				// I3, I4 are typed constants
	const F = 0.123456789					// F is an untyped constant, whose default type is float64
	const F32 float32 = F
	const F32b float32 = I
	const F64 float64 = F
	const C1, C2 complex64 = F, I
	
	// const F64b float64 = I3 // doesn't compile
	const F64b = float64(I3)   // compiles okay
	
	// const I5 int = C2 // doesn't compile
	const I5 = int(C2)   // compiles okay
}

6) non-constants
	- Non-constant floating-point and integer values can be explicitly converted to any floating-point and integer types.
	- Non-constant complex values can be explicitly converted to any complex types.

	Note: 
	Complex non-constant values can't be converted to floating-point and integer types.
	Floating-point and integer non-constant values can't be converted to complex types.
	Data overflow and rounding are allowed in non-constant number conversions. When converting a floating-point non-constant number 
	to an integer, the fraction is discarded (truncation towards zero).


package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var a, b = 1.6, -1.6 // both are float64
	fmt.Println(int(a), int(b)) // 1 -1

	var i, j int16 = 0x7FFF, -0x8000
	fmt.Println(int8(i), uint16(j)) // -1 32768

	var c1 complex64 = 1 + 2i
	var _ = complex128(c1)
}

Read Articles/golang/Value Conversion, Assignment and Comparison Rules in Go
and Articles/golang/golang_types.txt

Type Conversion
===============
Type conversion happens when we assign the value of one data type to another. Statically typed languages like C/C++, Java, 
provide the support for Implicit Type Conversion but Golang is different, as it doesn’t support the Automatic Type Conversion or
 Implicit Type Conversion. there is no typecasting word or terminology in Golang

The general syntax for converting a value val to a type T is T(val). 
for ex:
	var geek1 int = 845

	// explicit type conversion
	var geek2 float64 = float64(geek1)

	var geek3 int64 = int64(geek1)

	var geek4 uint = uint(geek1)
	
	var a []byte = []byte("hello")
	var s string = string([]byte{'h', 'e', 'l', 'l','o'})


Converting Between Integer Types
--------------------------------
Go has many integer data types to pick from. Go sometimes automatically generates numeric values as int, which may not match your input value. If your input value were int64, you would not be able to use the int and the int64 numbers in the same mathematical expression until you converted their data types to match.

smaller integer to larger conversion

ex: 
	var index int8 = 15
	var bigIndex int32
	bigIndex = int32(index)
	fmt.Println(bigIndex)
	
	Output
	15
	
fmt.Printf("index data type:    %T\n", index)
fmt.Printf("bigIndex data type: %T\n", bigIndex)
	Output
	index data type:    int8
	bigIndex data type: int32	
	
larger to smaller conversion

ex:

	var big int64 = 64
	var little int8
	little = int8(big)
	fmt.Println(little)
	
	Output
	64	

WrapAround
Keep in mind that when converting integers you could potentially exceed the maximum value of the data type and overflow.
When this occurs, the value may wrap to become a very small or negative number.

	var big int64 = 129
	var little = int8(big)
	fmt.Println(little)

	Output
	-127
	
because 129 = 127 + 2, so  127 + 1 is -128 and 	127 + 2 is -127
	
Converting Integers to Floats	
------------------------------

	var x int64 = 57
	var y float64 = float64(x)
	fmt.Printf("%.2f\n", y)
	
	Output
	57.00
	
converting floats to integers
-----------------------------

The conversion involves dropping the decimal place.

	var f float64 = 390.8
	var i int = int(f)
	fmt.Printf("f = %.2f\n", f)
	fmt.Printf("i = %d\n", i)

	Output
	f = 390.80
	i = 390	
	
Numbers Converted Through Division
----------------------------------
If, when dividing, any of the number types are a float, then all of the types will automatically be declared as a float:
	a := 5.0 / 2
	fmt.Println(a)
	
	Output
	2.5	

When dividing integer types in Go the result will also be an integer type
	a := 5 / 2
	fmt.Println(a)
	
	Output
	2

Conversion b/w Integers and strings
------------------------------------
The most common numeric conversions are Atoi (string to int) and Itoa (int to string).

i, err := strconv.Atoi("-42")
s := strconv.Itoa(-42)

conversion of values to strings
---------------------------------

s := strconv.FormatBool(true)
s := strconv.FormatFloat(3.1415, 'E', -1, 64)
s := strconv.FormatInt(-42, 16)
s := strconv.FormatUint(42, 16)


conversion of strings to values
-------------------------------

b, err := strconv.ParseBool("true")
f, err := strconv.ParseFloat("3.1415", 64)
i, err := strconv.ParseInt("-42", 10, 64)
u, err := strconv.ParseUint("42", 10, 64)





Converting Numbers to Strings
-----------------------------

Integers to Strings

When converting an integer to a string, the value is interpreted as a Unicode code point, 
and the resulting string will contain the character represented by that code point, encoded in UTF-8.
	
	string(97) // "a"
	
If the value does not represent a valid code point (for instance if it’s negative), the result will be "\ufffd", 
the Unicode replacement character �.

	string(-1) // "\ufffd" == "\xef\xbf\xbd"


Use strconv.Itoa to get the decimal string representation of an integer.
	
	strconv.Itoa(97) // "97"


ex: 	times := 5
	fmt.Println("hello number is " + times)
	
	output
	invalid operation: "hello number is " + times (mismatched types untyped string and int)
	
	fmt.Println("hello number is " + strconv.Itoa(times))

ex: 
	package main

	import (
		"fmt"
		"strconv"
	)

	func main() {
		a := strconv.Itoa(12)
		fmt.Printf("%q\n", a)
	}

	Output
	"12"

fmt.Sprintf to convert floats to strings

ex:
	times := 5.25
	fmt.Println("hello number is " + fmt.Sprintf("%f", times))	
	
	output
	hello number is 5.25
	
	
Note: 

strconv.Itoa formats an integer as a decimal string. Example: 
strconv.Itoa(65) and strconv.Itoa('A') return the string "65".

string(intValue) yields a string containing the UTF-8 representation of the integer. 
Example: string('A') and string(65) evaluate to the string "A".
	


Converting Strings to Numbers
-----------------------------

for ex:
	package main

	import (
		"fmt"
	)

	func main() {
		lines_yesterday := "50"
		lines_today := "108"

		lines_more := lines_today - lines_yesterday

		fmt.Println(lines_more)
	}
	
	Output
	invalid operation: lines_today - lines_yesterday (operator - not defined on string)	
	
strings to integers, we use strconv.Atoi 

ex: 
	package main
	import (
		"fmt"
		"log"
		"strconv"
	)

	func main() {
		lines_yesterday := "50"
		lines_today := "108"

		yesterday, err := strconv.Atoi(lines_yesterday)
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}

		today, err := strconv.Atoi(lines_today)
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
		lines_more := today - yesterday

		fmt.Println(lines_more)
	}
	
	Output
	58

Try converting something that is not a number

	package main

	import (
		"fmt"
		"strconv"
	)

	func main() {
		a := "not a number"
		b, err := strconv.Atoi(a)
		fmt.Println(b)
		fmt.Println(err)
	}
	You will get the following error:

	Output
	0
	strconv.Atoi: parsing "not a number": invalid syntax	
	

strings to floats, we use strconv.parseFloat

ex:
	f := "3.14159265"
	if s, err := strconv.ParseFloat(f, 32); err == nil {
	    fmt.Println(s) // 3.1415927410125732
	}
	if s, err := strconv.ParseFloat(f, 64); err == nil {
	    fmt.Println(s) // 3.14159265
	}	
	

Conversion between Strings and byte slices
--------------------------------------------

Converting a slice of bytes to a string type yields a string whose successive bytes are the elements of the slice.
	string([]byte{97, 230, 151, 165}) // "a日"

Converting a value of a string type to a slice of bytes type yields a slice whose successive elements are the bytes of the string.
	[]byte("a日")                     // []byte{97, 230, 151, 165}


Conversion between Strings and rune slices
-------------------------------------------

Converting a slice of runes to a string type yields a string that is the concatenation of the individual rune values converted to strings.
	string([]rune{97, 26085}) // "a日"

Converting a value of a string type to a slice of runes type yields a slice containing the individual Unicode code points of the string.
	[]rune("a日")             // []rune{97, 26085}	


Underlying type
---------------

A non-constant value can be converted to type T if it has the same underlying type as T.

In this example, the underlying type of int64, T1, and T2 is int64.

	type (
		T1 int64
		T2 T1
	)
It’s idiomatic in Go to convert the type of an expression to access a specific method.

	var n int64 = 12345
	fmt.Println(n)                // 12345
	fmt.Println(time.Duration(n)) // 12.345µs
(The underlying type of time.Duration is int64, and the time.Duration type has a String method that returns the duration formatted as a time.)


Implicit conversions
---------------------
The only implicit conversion in Go is when an untyped constant is used in a situation where a type is required.

In this example the untyped literals 1 and 2 are implicitly converted.

	var x float64
	x = 1 // Same as x = float64(1)

	t := 2 * time.Second // Same as t := time.Duration(2) * time.Second
(The implicit conversions are necessary since there is no mixing of numeric types in Go. You can only multiply a time.Duration with another time.Duration.)

When the type can’t be inferred from the context, an untyped constant is converted to a bool, int, float64, complex128, string or rune depending on the syntactical format of the constant.

	n := 1   // Same as n := int(1)
	x := 1.0 // Same as x := float64(1.0)
	s := "A" // Same as s := string("A")
	c := 'A' // Same as c := rune('A')

Illegal implicit conversions are caught by the compiler.

	var b byte = 256 // Same as var b byte = byte(256)
	../main.go:2:6: constant 256 overflows byte
	
	
Type assertions and type switches	
==================================
	
Type assertions
----------------
A type assertion doesn’t really convert an interface to another data type, but it provides access to an interface’s concrete value, which is typically what you want.

The type assertion x.(T) asserts that the concrete value stored in x is of type T, and that x is not nil.

If T is not an interface, it asserts that the dynamic type of x is identical to T.
If T is an interface, it asserts that the dynamic type of x implements T.
	var x interface{} = "foo"

	var s string = x.(string)
	fmt.Println(s)     // "foo"

	s, ok := x.(string)
	fmt.Println(s, ok) // "foo true"

	n, ok := x.(int)
	fmt.Println(n, ok) // "0 false"

	n = x.(int)        // ILLEGAL
panic: interface conversion: interface {} is string, not int
	
Type switches
-------------

A type switch performs several type assertions in series and runs the first case with a matching type.

	var x interface{} = "foo"

	switch v := x.(type) {
	case nil:
	    fmt.Println("x is nil")            // here v has type interface{}
	case int: 
	    fmt.Println("x is", v)             // here v has type int
	case bool, string:
	    fmt.Println("x is bool or string") // here v has type interface{}
	default:
	    fmt.Println("type unknown")        // here v has type interface{}
	}
	
	output
	x is bool or string
