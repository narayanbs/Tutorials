Input/Output:
-------------
Primarily involves Reading and Writing bytes. for ex: in the case of Text IO, the bytes will be interpreted according to the character
encoding rules and returned back. But bottom line is, its just reading and writing bytes with the additional step of interpretation. 

Linux provides two system calls for reading and writing.
	int read(int fd, char buf[], size_t len);
	int write(int fd, char buf[], size_t len); 

They take a file descriptor and a buffer with a certain length and perform i/o.

read() attempts to read up to len bytes from file descriptor fd into the buffer starting at buf. 

On success, the number of bytes read is returned and the file position is advanced by this number. It is not an error if this number is 
smaller than the number of bytes requested;
if number is zero, it indicates EOF.
If the file offset is at or past the end of file, no bytes are read, and read() returns zero. it indicates end of file. 
if the length of the supplied buffer "len" is zero, and if there are no errors when read() is performed, the result is 
returns zero with no side effects.

On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

write() writes up to len bytes from the buffer starting at buf to the file referred to by the file descriptor fd.

On success, the number of bytes written is returned.  

On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

Note: The number of bytes written may be less than len if, for example, there is insufficient space on the underlying physical medium, 
or the RLIMIT_FSIZE resource limit is encountered. In the event of a partial write, the caller can make another write() call to transfer the
remaining bytes. The subsequent call will either transfer further bytes or may result in an error (e.g., if the disk is now full).


-------------------

Imagine a library using these system calls, like the C library or the golang library and request single bytes. The overhead of system 
calls adds to inefficiency. So libraries normally use a buffer so as to reduce system calls.

For ex: 
In c library, FILE internally contains a buffer of 4096 bytes. when a call like fgets or fread or fgetc is made with a buffer that
is less that this, then FILE just makes a single system call and handles the read.

ex:
int main() {
	FILE* fp;
	if((fp = fopen("somefile.txt", "r")) == NULL) {
		fprintf(stdout, "Error opening file\n");
		exit(1);
	}
	// If you uncomment below, then fp will be used without buffer
	// and each call to fgetc(fp) and putchar will invoke system calls
	// read and write respectively.

	// setvbuf(fp, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
	int c = 0;
	while(c=fgetc(fp), !feof(fp)) {
		putchar(c);
	}
}





This is the point of Buffered I/O in languages in golang. 
Normal Reader and Writer, provide Read and Write methods, that lets you choose the size of the buffer you provide. sometimes if the buffer
size is too less then there may be many system calls, By default bufio uses a buffer of 4096 and makes your job easier. 

ex: 
suppose we have a file somefile.txt with 96 bytes of data inside it. 
Now if we read this file using golang, and we retrieve only 10 bytes at a time

func main() {
  f, err := os.Open("somefile.txt")
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "fatal error:%s\n", err.Error())
    os.Exit(1)
  }
  defer f.Close()
  buf := make([]byte, 10)
  for {
    if n, err := f.Read(buf); err != nil {
      if err == io.EOF {
        fmt.Printf("%d\n", n)
        break
      }
      os.Exit(1)
    }
  }
}

and if we use strace to see the system call invocation.

$ strace -e trace=desc ./ioex

we notices a series of system calls

read(3, " to fill\ns", 10)              = 10
read(3, "ome random", 10)               = 10
read(3, " sentence ", 10)               = 10
read(3, "to fill\nso", 10)              = 10
read(3, "me random ", 10)               = 10
read(3, "sentence t", 10)               = 10
read(3, "o fill\nsom", 10)              = 10
read(3, "e random s", 10)               = 10
read(3, "entence to", 10)               = 10
read(3, " fill\n", 10)                  = 6
read(3, "", 10)                         = 0


Now suppose we rewrite the same program but use buffered input/output (bufio)

func main() {
  f, err := os.Open("somefile.txt")
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "fatal error:%s\n", err.Error())
    os.Exit(1)
  }
  defer f.Close()
  r := bufio.NewReader(f)
  buf := make([]byte, 10)
  for {
    if n, err := r.Read(buf); err != nil {
      if err == io.EOF {
        fmt.Printf("%d\n", n)
        break
      }
      os.Exit(1)
    }
  }
}


We notice a single system call where the size of the buffer is 4k. 

read(3, "some random sentence to fill\nsom"..., 4096) = 116

This is where buffered io helps.

------------------------------------------

In C programming, standard input/output streams can be buffered in different ways. 
The buffering behavior depends on the type of stream and how itâ€™s used.

### 1. **Line Buffered Streams:**
   - **Standard Input (`stdin`)** is **line buffered** when connected to a terminal. This means that input 
   is buffered until a newline (`\n`) character is encountered. The data is then passed to the program.

   - **Standard Output (`stdout`)** is **line buffered** when connected to a terminal. This means that output 
   is buffered until a newline character is written, at which point the output is sent to the terminal.

   - **Standard Error (`stderr`)** is **unbuffered**, meaning that it doesn't get buffered, and output is 
   immediately written to the terminal.

### 2. **Fully Buffered Streams:**
   - Files opened for reading and writing are typically **fully buffered**. This means that data is buffered 
   and only written to or read from the file when the buffer is full (or when you explicitly flush it).

   - **Standard Output (`stdout`)** is **fully buffered** when redirected to a file or a pipe. In this case, 
   data is buffered and written in chunks when the buffer fills up.

   - **Standard Input (`stdin`)** is also fully buffered if redirected from a file.

### Key Differences:
- **Line buffered:** Buffering happens when a newline character is encountered (usually associated with terminal input/output).
- **Fully buffered:** Buffering happens until the buffer is full (usually associated with file I/O).

You can also change the buffering behavior using functions like `setbuf()` or `setvbuf()`.
