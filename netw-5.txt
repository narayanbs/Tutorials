Things to remember while developing a web server.

* create and open a TCP socket
* Request / Response of HTTP protocol is as follows

Request (GET & POST)
----------------------

GET /path HTTP/1.1\r\n
Header-Name: Header-Value\r\n
Header-Name: Header-Value\r\n
Header-Name: Header-Value\r\n
Header-Name: Header-Value\r\n
\r\n

POST /path HTTP/1.1\r\n
Header-Name: Header-Value\r\n
Header-Name: Header-Value\r\n
Header-Name: Header-Value\r\n
Header-Name: Header-Value\r\n
\r\n
REQUEST-BODY

Response
-----------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n
Header-Name: Header-Value\r\n
Header-Name: Header-Value\r\n
Header-Name: Header-Value\r\n
Header-Name: Header-Value\r\n
\r\n
RESPONSE-BODY

* Content-Length header may be available for PUT/POST requests, but not for GET requests
* The size of the buffer used in socket.recv() (4k, 8k, 16k...) may not be big enough to handle the payload.
* In the case of POST/PUT requests we can use the Content-Length Header and make multiple sock.recv to fetch all the data. 
* The Content-Length header should be part of the response. 
* Transfer-Encoding header specifies the form of encoding used to safely transfer the payload body
It is normally used when a response is sent. None of the browsers send it as part of the request. 

Possible values include

Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Transfer-Encoding: compress
Transfer-Encoding: deflate
Transfer-Encoding: gzip

// Several values can be listed, separated by a comma
Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked

chunked - Data is sent in a series of chunks. The Content-Length header is omitted in this case and at 
the beginning of each chunk you need to add the length of the current chunk in hexadecimal format,
followed by '\r\n' and then the chunk itself, followed by another '\r\n'. The terminating chunk is a 
regular chunk, with the exception that its length is zero. It is followed by the trailer, which consists 
of a (possibly empty) sequence of header fields.
Example of a chunked response

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

7\r\n
Mozilla\r\n
11\r\n
Developer Network\r\n
0\r\n
\r\ni


Chunked encoding is useful when larger amounts of data are sent to the client and the total size of the 
response may not be known until the request has been fully processed. For example, when generating a large 
HTML table resulting from a database query or when transmitting large images.


compress - A format using the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) algorithm
deflate - using the zlib structure with deflate algorithm
gzip - A format using the Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77), with a 32-bit CRC
