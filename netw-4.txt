Summary: Basics, Transport Layer: TCP/UDP
=============================================

* The application layer operates as processes that communicate between
  hosts. Transport layer provides process-to-process delivery of 
  messages. The underlying network layer provides host-to-host 
  delivery of messages, without any reliability guarantees. 
  So, job of transport layer is to take this host-to-host delivery
  service from the network layer, and provide process-to-process 
  delivery abstraction to the application layer.

* Processes send messages via sockets. So, we can also think of the
  transport layer as providing a data delivery service from socket to
  socket.

* Some terminology: application layer "message" -> transport layer
  "segment" -> IP/network layer "packets" -> link layer  "frames".

* Main functions of transport layer:

- Multiplexing and demultiplexing (mux/demux): several processes on a
  host may be sending messages. Each application process is assigned a
  port number. Transport layer takes the application layer message,
  appends port number, and passes to network layer. At the receiver
  end, it hands over message to correct application process based on
  port number. Both TCP and UDP provide this basic mux/demux
  functionality. In fact, UDP is a barebones transport layer that
  provides ONLY this functionality.

- Reliable data delivery: TCP provides reliable data delivery. That
  is, the application can be assured that the message will reach the
  other side (or it will know if lost). TCP provides reliability using
  several mechanisms, on top of a unreliable network layer.

- Congestion control: TCP ensures that data from one application does
  not swamp all the links and routers on the path. Congestion control
  is not so much a service to the application as it is a service to
  the Internet.

* What are function that transport layer cannot provide? It cannot
  provide bandwidth or delay guarantees because the underlying network
  layer does not provide guarantees. Note that IP layer does not
  provide security either, but TCP has special mechanisms (SSL) to
  provide security over unsecure transport. But bandwidth/delay
  guarantee is harder.

* Two main transport protocols: TCP and UDP.

* TCP is a connection oriented protocol, i.e., there are a few
  connection establishment messages before data can be sent from
  sender to receiver. However, this connection state resides only at
  end hosts; unlike connections in circuit switching where state is
  established at all routers on path. The side that initiates
  connection is called TCP client. The side that responds is called
  server. Data flow can happen both ways, TCP is full duplex.

* Recall from socket programming: both client and server first create
  sockets. Client sends a connect request to server IP and port. Then,
  the "TCP handshake" takes place. TCP client sends a SYN packet to
  server to initiate connection. Server responds with SYNACK. Client
  then sends SYN ACK ACK (or simply ACK), along with any data
  possibly. At this point, the accept call at the server returns,
  i.e., the server accepts the request, a new client socket is created
  for this connection, and connection is said to be established. Once
  connection is established, both client and server may send data
  through the TCP connection via the sockets. This data exchange
  translates to read/write on sockets.

* So when a packet arrives at a host, how does TCP know which client
  socket to deliver message to? TCP uses 4-tuple (source IP, source
  port, destination IP, destination port) as the demux key to identify
  appropriate socket. Why can't it just use destination IP and port?
  Because server can have several sockets open for different clients.

* How is mux/demux done in UDP? Note that there is no handshake in
  UDP. Sender and receiver applications create sockets, and fill in
  the destination port and IP in the socket structures. Then they
  simply send and receive messages using the socket handle. The source
  and destination port numbers are embedded in the UDP header. Note
  that a UDP-based server only has one listening socket, not one per
  client. When a packet reaches the destination IP address (via
  network layer), the destination port is looked up to identify the
  correct socket to deliver the message to. That is, the demux "key"
  is the 2-tuple (destination IP, destination port). 

* Why is demux key different for UDP (2-tuple) vs TCP (4-tuple)?
  Because TCP maintains a separate socket for every client-server
  communication (connection-oriented), whereas UDP server processes
  all clients via the same socket. So, next question, why is TCP
  connection oriented and why does it have to maintain a separate
  socket for every connection? Because TCP implements reliability, it
  is easier with separate sockets. For example, when a message arrives
  at a socket, it is easy to simply see the source IP/port associated
  with that socket and send ACK. If you want to send a reply to a UDP
  message, you need to extract the source IP and port from the UDP
  header for every message.

* There is not much else to UDP other than mux/demux. UDP is just
  barebones transport: mux/demux with light error detection (checksum
  over header: includes port numbers and checksum (IP addresses are from IP
  header). Lower header overhead than TCP (UDP-8 bytes, TCP-20 bytes).

* Which applications use UDP?

- DNS: simple request reply does not justify the overhead of
  connection setup of TCP.

- Multimedia applications: they have more control over what data is
  sent when. For example, if the voice sample is stale, no point in
  TCP retransmitting it.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what does readable/writable mean in a socket file descriptor

During calls like select, we register sockets along with interesting events like read/write/exceptions. The 
select command returns sockets that are readable or writable? But what does it really mean?

A socket is readable if
* The number of bytes in the socket receive buffer is equal/greater than the low-water mark specified.
  A read operation on the socket will not block and return a value greater than 0.
* The read half of the connection is closed i.e the tcp connection has received a FIN
  A read operation on the socket will not block and will return 0
* A socket error is pending
  A read operation will not block and will return an error (-1)
* The socket is a listening socket and the number of completed connections is non-zero

A socket is writable if
* The number of bytes of available space in the socket send buffer is greater its low-water mark.
  and either (i) the socket is connected, or (ii) the socket does not require a connection (e.g., UDP). 
  This means that if we set the socket to nonblocking, a write operation will not block and will return 
  a positive value (e.g., the number of bytes accepted by the transport layer). [...]
* The write half of the connection is closed. A write operation on the socket will generate SIGPIPE.
* A socket using a non-blocking connect has completed the connection, or the connect has failed.
* A socket error is pending. A write operation on the socket will not block and will return an error (–1)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is only necessary to bind() a server, because the clients need a fixed port number to send to. 
A client needn't bind() at all: an automatic bind() will take place on the during the connect call, or 
during the first send()/sendto()/recv()/recvfrom() using a system-assigned local port number.

accept() is for TCP. It has nothing to do with UDP.

connect() in tcp initiates the tcp handshake. 
connect() in UDP doesn't do anything to the other end, it just conditions the local API to know who you are sending to and receiving from.
Hence we can use the send and recv functions.

If you don't already know that, or don't care, or want to send to multiple destinations with the same socket, you don't use connect(), 
you use sendto() instead. Similarly for receiving.

Consider a UDP server for example. It would call recvfrom(), so it would get the source address information, process the request, 
create the response, and send it to that address via sendto(). No connect() involved anywhere, therefore not possible to use either send() or recv().

----------------------------------
Point to remember : For servers, set AI_PASSIVE flag in getaddrinfo, if host is NULL then INADDR_ANY or INADDR6_ANY_INIT is assumed, else it is ignored.
For clients, don't set the AI_PASSIVE FLAG, if host is NULL then Loopback address is assumed for clients. 
----------------------------------

TCP connection -- connect, listen and accept()
----------------------------------------------
connect() is called by the client process to connect to a server process. Internally in the TCP stack this is what happens.
If client process has not explicitly issued a bind call, implicit binding on the local socket is taken care by the stack.
The destination socket pair (IP and port) specified by connect is checked if its unique or not. It updates its internet control block
with the destination address and port number. The request is sent to the address and the status of the client socket is set to SYN_SENT. 
The connect call is put to sleep.

On the server_side the syn packet is received. A listener socket is looked up. If it's found its state is TCP_LISTEN. 
A request socket (a mini-socket) is created and added to a ehash accept queue. It's status is set to SYN_RCVD. A syn-ack is sent back. 

The SYN_ACK is received on the client side. The packet is now processed and the connect is woken up. 
The socket on the client side is established. ACK packet is sent back to the server. 

The server removes the incomplete request socket from the accept queue, and puts it into the completed socket queue. 
Then wakeup() is called to wake up the accept call. The socket on the server side is now establised.

Not send and recv happens between the established sockets.

TCP connection -- listen() and accept()
----------------------------------------
What happens when a server accepts client sockets?>> accept() 

When you create a socket and do a bind on that socket and then a listen, what you have is what is called a listening socket. When a connection 
is established this socket is basically cloned to a new socket, and this socket is called the servicing socket the port to which it bound is 
still the same as the original port.

But there is an important distinction between this socket and the listening socket from before. Namely it is part of a socket pair. 
It is the socket pair that uniquely identifies the connection. so as there are 2 sockets in the picture for a socket pair, 
there are 2 IP addresses and 2 ports for both ends of the TCP communication channel. During the cloning of the servicing socket, 
the TCP kernel will allocate what is called a TCB (Transmission control block) and in it it will store those 2 IPs and 2 ports. 
The TCB also contains the socket number that belongs to the TCB.

Each time a TCP segment comes in , the TCP header is checked and whether or not it is a SYN, for a SYN you would have connection 
establishment so that you passed already, but then the kernel is going through its list of listening sockets. 
If it is a normal TCP packet, not a SYN, both port numbers are in the TCP header and the IPs are part of the IP header, 
so using this information the kernel is able to find the TCB that belongs to this TCP connection.
(For a SYN, this information is also there, but as I said, for a SYN you have to process only the listening sockets)

That is in a nutshell how it works.

This information can be found in UNIX Network Programming: the sockets networking API. 
In there the link to the sockets is described whereas in other reference material it is usually not described that much in detail, 
rather the nitty grits of TCP are usually highlighted.

UDP Client
----------
consider these two snippets. They do the same thing — send a packet to the DNS resolver. 

First snippet is using a connected socket:

cd = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
cd.connect(("1.1.1.1", 53))
cd.send(b"Hello world")
data = cd.recv(2048)

If we use connect in the case of UDP, then addr is the address to which datagrams are sent by default, and the only
address from which datagrams are received.

so here we can only send datagrams to 1.1.1.1 and receive from 1.1.1.1

Second snippet is using unconnected one:

sd = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
sd.bind(("0.0.0.0", 0))
sd.sendto(b"Hello world", ("1.1.1.1", 53))
data = sd.recv(2048)

The socket is bound to a local address and datagram is sent to the address mentioned in the sendto() function. 
similarly the socket can receive datagrams from any other source that has the local address as the destination. 


Generally speaking for outbound traffic it's preferable to use connected UDP sockets.

UDP Server
-----------
Traditionally on the server side UDP requires unconnected sockets.

sd = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
sd.bind((host, port))
while True:
	data, addr = sd.revfrom(2048)
	sd.sendto(data,addr)


-----------------------------------------------------
getaddrinfo -- Network Address and Service translation. Returns one or more addrinfo structures, each of which contains 
an Internet address that can be specified in a call to bind(2) or connect(2).

struct addrinfo {
               int              ai_flags;
               int              ai_family;
               int              ai_socktype;
               int              ai_protocol;
               socklen_t        ai_addrlen;
               struct sockaddr *ai_addr;
               char            *ai_canonname;
               struct addrinfo *ai_next;
           };

int getaddrinfo(const char *restrict node,
                       const char *restrict service,
                       const struct addrinfo *restrict hints,
                       struct addrinfo **restrict res);

node --> Identifies an internet host

service --> Identifies a service, 
		if a service name (/etc/services) then it is translated to corresponding port number
		If a decimal number it is simply converted to binary.  
		If service is NULL, then the port number of the returned socket addresses will be left uninitialized
		
hints --> points to an addrinfo structure that specifies criteria for selecting the socket address structures returned in the list pointed to by res.
	hints.ai_family --> AF_INET, AF_INET6, AF_UNSPEC
	hints.ai_socktype --> SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_DGRAM
	hints.ai_protocol --> 0
	hints.ai_flags -->
			AI_NUMERICHOST then node must be numeric network address, thus skips lengthy network lookups.
			AI_PASSIVE: is set then 
				if node is null, then returned socket address will contain wildcard address
					i.e INADDR_ANY for ipv4 or IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT for ipv6
				if node is not null, AI_PASSIVE is ignored.
			AI_PASSIVE: is not set then 
				sockets are suitable for use in connect, sendto
				if node is null, then network address will be loopback addresses
					i.e INADDR_LOOPBACK for ipv4 or IN6ADDR_LOOPBACK_INIT ipv6 
			
Specifying hints as NULL is equivalent to setting ai_socktype and ai_protocol to 0; 
	ai_family to AF_UNSPEC; and ai_flags to (AI_V4MAPPED | AI_ADDRCONFIG).
