CSS
---
css rules - apply a set of properties to an element identified using a css-selector

<css-selector> {
	property: value;
	property: value;
}

ex:
h1 {
	color: blue;
}

Individual selectors can be combined into a selector list, if they share a rule.

ex:
h1 {
	color:blue;
}

.special {
	color:blue;
}

h1, .special {
	color:blue;
}

--------------------------
Type Selectors -- where the css-selector is a html element

span {
  background-color: yellow;
}

strong {
  color: rebeccapurple;
}

em {
  color: rebeccapurple;
}

class selectors - target an element that has a specific value for its class attribute:

.box {

}

Id selectors - target an element that has a specific value for its id attribute

#unique {

}

Attribute selectors - gives you different ways to select elements based on the presence of a certain attribute on an element:

a[href="https://example.com"]
{

}

Pseudo-classes - select element based on the state. 
	for ex: element could be the first child, it is being hovered over by mouse-pointer etc

a:hover {

}

Pseudo-elements - select a part of the element rather than the element itself. This part acts as an element itself

p::first-line {

}

Combinators - combine selectors to target elements in the document. 
	(i.e direct children, descendents .. etc)

child combinator
article > p {
}

Next sibling combinator
p + img {
}

descendent combinator
body article p 

subsequent sibling combinator
p ~ img



Cascade, specificity and inheritance 
------------------------------------
Stylesheets cascade — at a very simple level, this means that the origin, the cascade layer, and the order of CSS rules matter. 
When two rules from the same cascade layer apply and both have equal specificity, the one that is defined last in the stylesheet 
is the one that will be used.

Specificity is the algorithm that the browser uses to decide which property value is applied to an element. 
If multiple style blocks have different selectors that configure the same property with different values and 
target the same element, specificity decides the property value that gets applied to the element.
An element selector is less specific; it will select all elements of that type that appear on a page, so it has less weight.
Pseudo-element selectors have the same specificity as regular element selectors.
A class selector is more specific; it will select only the elements on a page that have a specific class attribute value, 
so it has more weight. Attribute selectors and pseudo-classes have the same weight as a class.
Inheritance also needs to be understood in this context — some CSS property values set on parent elements are inherited 
by their child elements, and some aren't.

When conflicts arise, the term "cascading" refers to the hierarchical order in which different style sheet types interact. 
Style sheets are cascaded in the following order: Browser Defaults. External Style Sheets (Linked or Imported) Internal Style Sheets (Embedded)
