C language Keynotes
===========================
##### Initialization and Assignment of Array
Both may use the = operator but arrays are not assignable. 
for ex: 
  int arr[] = { 1,2,3,4,5}; is initialization, but

  int arr[];
  arr = {1,2,3,4,5}; is not allowed. 

Another example

struct Person {
    char name[10];
    int age;
};

Person p = {.name="narayan", .age=40}; // ok
Person p;
p.name = "narayan"; // not ok 

##### Effective type of Object

Effective type of an object is the type given when the object is declared. 
ex:
int x;  effective type is int. 

Memory returned from `malloc` has no effective type. For example:

int *x = malloc(sizeof(int));

Assuming an `int` is 4 bytes in size, `x` now points to 4 bytes of memory with no 
effective type. This memory gets an effective type when assigned to:

*x = 123; 
Now those bytes have an effective type of `int`.

Alignment
----------------
In C programming, pointer alignment refers to the way pointers are positioned in memory 
relative to the boundaries of the data types they point to. Alignment is important for 
performance reasons and for adhering to the requirements of certain hardware 
architectures.

What Does "Aligned to the Correct Type" Mean?
When we say a pointer is "aligned to the correct type," we are referring to the fact that 
the pointer's address is properly aligned according to the type of data it points to. 
Different types of data may have different alignment requirements. For example:

char: Typically has the least strict alignment requirements and can be aligned at any 
byte boundary.
int: May require alignment to a 4-byte boundary (on many systems).
double: Might need to be aligned to an 8-byte boundary.
The alignment requirements are dictated by the hardware and can affect the performance of 
memory access operations. If a pointer is not correctly aligned for the type it points 
to, accessing data through that pointer can lead to inefficient access or even hardware 
exceptions on some systems.

Why Is Alignment Important?
Performance: Many CPUs are optimized to access memory efficiently when data is aligned on 
certain boundaries. Misaligned access can be slower or require additional instructions to 
handle.

Hardware Constraints: Some architectures require that data be aligned to specific 
boundaries. Accessing misaligned data can lead to hardware exceptions or crashes.
Portability: Proper alignment ensures that your code runs correctly across different 
hardware platforms, which may have different alignment requirements.

Example of obtaining alignment of types
----------------------------------------
#include <stdalign.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  // Print the alignment requirements of various types
  printf("Alignment of char: %zu bytes\n", alignof(char));
  printf("Alignment of int: %zu bytes\n", alignof(int));
  printf("Alignment of double: %zu bytes\n", alignof(double));
  printf("Alignment of long: %zu bytes\n", alignof(long));
  printf("Alignment of long long: %zu bytes\n", alignof(long long));
  printf("Alignment of struct { char c; int i; }: %zu bytes\n", alignof(struct {
           char c;
           int i;
         }));

  // Define a struct with different types
  struct MyStruct {
    char c;
    int i;
    double d;
  };

  // Print the alignment requirement of the struct
  printf("Alignment of MyStruct { char c; int i; double d; }; : %zu bytes\n",
         alignof(struct MyStruct));

  return 0;
}

Output:

Alignment of char: 1 bytes
Alignment of int: 4 bytes
Alignment of double: 8 bytes
Alignment of long: 8 bytes
Alignment of long long: 8 bytes
Alignment of struct { char c; int i; }: 4 bytes
Alignment of MyStruct { char c; int i; double d; }; : 8 bytes

Examples of Allocation with specific alignment
---------------------------------------------
Using posix_memalign:

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    void *ptr;
    size_t alignment = 16; // Must be a power of 2 and a multiple of `sizeof(void *)`
    size_t size = 1024;    // Size of memory to allocate


    if (posix_memalign(&ptr, alignment, size) != 0) {
        perror("posix_memalign failed");
        return 1;
    }

    // Use ptr as needed
    printf("Memory allocated at address: %p\n", ptr);

    free(ptr); // Free the allocated memory
    return 0;
}

Using aligned_alloc: (C11)

The alignment must be a power of two and a multiple of sizeof(void *).

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    void *ptr;
    size_t alignment = 16; // Must be a power of 2 and a multiple of `sizeof(void *)`
    size_t size = 1024;    // Size of memory to allocate

    ptr = aligned_alloc(alignment, size);
    if (ptr == NULL) {
        perror("aligned_alloc failed");
        return 1;
    }

    // Use ptr as needed
    printf("Memory allocated at address: %p\n", ptr);

    free(ptr); // Free the allocated memory
    return 0;
}

malloc
-----------
According to the C standard, malloc guarantees that the memory it returns is suitably 
aligned for any kind of object, meaning it should be aligned according to the 
requirements of the most restrictive data type supported by the implementation. This 
typically means that the memory is aligned to the size of the largest data type (like 
double or long long) that the platform supports.
On most systems, malloc returns memory aligned to at least the size of void * or the 
maximum alignment required by the most restrictive data type. This ensures that you can 
safely use the allocated memory for any type without worrying about alignment issues.

Consider the following example:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    if (ptr == NULL) {
        perror("Failed to allocate memory");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Address of ptr: %p\n", (void *)ptr);
    printf("Address of *ptr: %p\n", (void *)ptr);

    // Check if address is correctly aligned for an integer
    if ((uintptr_t)ptr % alignof(int) == 0) {
        printf("Pointer is correctly aligned for int.\n");
    } else {
        printf("Pointer is not correctly aligned for int.\n");
    }

    free(ptr);
    return 0;
}

In this code:

malloc allocates memory for an int, which should naturally be aligned to the size 
required for an int.
We check the alignment by using modulo arithmetic with alignof(int), which tells us the 
alignment requirement for an int on the system.

Note:  
According to the C standard the cases where the pointer is known to be aligned 
to the target type include the following:
* The pointer could point to an object declared with a suitable alignment specifier. 
* It could point to an object returned by aligned_alloc(), calloc(), malloc(), or realloc(),


casting, strict aliasing, type punning rules of pointers in C
-----------------------------------------------------------------
If a pointer is known to be correctly aligned to the target type, then a cast to that type is permitted. 
For example, The following compliant solution uses the alignment specifier, which is new to C11, 
to declare the char object c with the same alignment as that of an object of type int. As a result, the two pointers 
reference equally aligned pointer types:

#include <stdalign.h>
#include <assert.h>
  
void func(void) {
  /* Align c to the alignment of an int */
  alignas(int) char c = 'x';
  int *ip = (int *)&c;
  char *cp = (char *)ip;
  /* Both cp and &c point to equally aligned objects */
  assert(cp == &c);
}

Before we talk more about casting and type punning let's look at another rule, 

Strict Aliasing
---------------
Strict aliasing rule in C standard enables the compiler to optimize code under the assumption that pointers to different 
types do not point to the same memory location. This means that no two pointers of incompatible types point to the same memory 
location. 

for ex:

```
	void f(float *x, int * y) {
		*x = 1;
		*y = 2;
		return *x;
	}
```

Here the compiler knows that x and y cannot alias at the same location. so it can 
optimize the code to return 1 directly without accessing the memory. 
But if the function had both `int *` arguments, x and y could point at the same memory 
location, the compiler has to fetch the code from x and return it. even though it could 
have just returned 1. 

The above rule can affect casting between pointer types. For example, 
casting a float * to an int * and accessing the same memory through both pointers is not 
strictly allowed by the standard. The compiler might generate incorrect code under the 
assumption that the two types do not alias

for ex: Say we call the above function like this

	int main() {
	    int x = 0;
	    std::cout << x << "\n";   // Expect 0
	    x = f(reinterpret_cast<float*>(&x), &x);
	    std::cout << x << "\n";   // Expect 0?
	}

``
Type Punning
--------------
Say we want to circumvent the type system and interpret an object as a different type. This is called type punning, 
to reinterpret a segment of memory as another type. Type punning is useful for tasks that want access to the underlying 
representation of an object to view, transport or manipulate. Typical areas we find type punning being used are compilers,
serialization, networking code, etc…
Traditionally this has been accomplished by taking the address of the object, casting it to a pointer of the type we want to 
reinterpret it as and then accessing the value, or in other words by aliasing. For example:

int x = 1;

// In C
float *fp = (float*)&x;  // Not a valid aliasing

// In C++
float *fp = reinterpret_cast<float*>(&x);  // Not a valid aliasing

printf( "%f\n", *fp );

As we have seen earlier this is not a valid aliasing, so we are invoking undefined behavior. But traditionally compilers did not 
take advantage of strict aliasing rules and this type of code usually just worked, developers have unfortunately gotten used to 
doing things this way. 

A common alternate method for type punning is through unions, which is valid in C but undefined behavior in C++

union u1
{
    int n;
    float f;
};

union u1 u;
u.f = 1.0f;

printf( "%d\n", u.n );  // UB in C++ n is not the active member

So, How do we Type Pun correctly?

The standard method for type punning in both C and C++ is memcpy. This may seem a little heavy handed but the optimizer should 
recognize the use of memcpy for type punning and optimize it away and generate a register to register move. 

Let's look at an example. 
A classic case of type punning is the Quake III fast inverse square root function, where the bits of an 
IEEE 754 floating-point number are interpreted as a 32-bit integer:

float y = number;
long  i = *(long *) &y;                 // evil floating point bit level hacking
i       = 0x5f3759df - (i >> 1);        // what the fuck? 
y       = *(float *) &i;


using memcpy, valid version of the inverse square root code could be:

float y = number;
uint32_t i;
static_assert(sizeof(i) == sizeof(y), "error: different sizes");
std::memcpy(&i, &y, sizeof(i));         // evil floating point bit level hacking
i = 0x5f3759df - (i >> 1);              // what the fuck? 
std::memcpy(&y, &i, sizeof(y));

In C++20 we may use bit_cast

float y = number;
auto  i = std::bit_cast<uint32_t>(y);   // evil floating point bit level hacking
i       = 0x5f3759df - (i >> 1);        // what the fuck? 
y       = std::bit_cast<float>(i);
std::cout << bit_cast<float>(0x447a0000) << "\n"; //assuming sizeof(float) == sizeof(unsigned int)


Before finishing, according to the C Standard the following casts are valid
-----------------------------------
It is safe to
* Convert a pointer from any type T* to any type U* if alignof(U) <= alignof(T)
* Cast from any object-pointer type to void *
* Cast from any object-pointer type to char *, signed char * or unsigned char *
* Cast among pointers to types differing only in signedness and / or type qualifiers. i.e (signed, unsigned, const, volatile etc)
* Cast from a pointer to a structure type to a pointer to the type of the structure's first member
* Cast from a pointer to a union type to a pointer to the type of any member of the union
* Cast from a pointer to an array type to a pointer to the array's element type, and vice versa
* Cast directly from a type T* to a type U* if one can safely convert from T* to U* via one or more safe intermediate conversions.
* Cast between any two function-pointer types

Note:
The safety of a pointer conversion is only about the conversion itself. It is not necessarily safe to dereference the pointer
resulting from a safe conversion, or, for function pointers, to call the pointed-to function via the converted pointer.
