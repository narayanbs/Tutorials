OpenSSH, GPG (GnuPG), and OpenSSL are all cryptographic tools that serve different purposes and have distinct functionalities:

1. **OpenSSH (Open Secure Shell)**:
   - **Purpose**: OpenSSH is primarily used for secure remote login and file transfer between machines over an unsecured network. 
   It provides encrypted communication sessions using the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol.
   - **Features**: It includes tools like `ssh` (for remote login), `scp` (for secure copy), and `sftp` (for secure file transfer). 
   OpenSSH also supports tunneling, port forwarding, and public key authentication.

2. **GPG (GnuPG, GNU Privacy Guard)**:
   - **Purpose**: GPG is used for encryption and signing of data and communications. It implements the OpenPGP standard and provides 
   cryptographic privacy and authentication.
   - **Features**: GPG can encrypt and decrypt files, emails, and data streams. It uses a combination of symmetric-key cryptography (for efficiency)
   and public-key cryptography (for secure key exchange and digital signatures). 
   GPG is often used for secure email communication, file encryption, and software package verification.

3. **OpenSSL**:
   - **Purpose**: OpenSSL is a general-purpose cryptographic library that provides an open-source implementation of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols.
   - **Features**: OpenSSL offers a wide range of cryptographic functions and utilities, including SSL/TLS handshake protocols, 
   cryptographic algorithms (such as AES, RSA, DSA), digital certificates (X.509), and secure random number generation. 
   It is used extensively in web servers, applications requiring secure communication, and for creating digital certificates.


- **Use Cases**:
  - Use OpenSSH when you need to securely access remote systems or transfer files securely over a network.
  - Use GPG when you need to encrypt files, emails, or messages, or to sign them for authentication purposes.
  - Use OpenSSL when you need to implement SSL/TLS security in applications, manage digital certificates, or perform various cryptographic operations programmatically.

- **Interoperability**:
  - OpenSSH and OpenSSL are often used together in securing network communications and managing cryptographic keys.
  - GPG is used independently but can be integrated with email clients, file managers, and other applications for secure communication and data encryption.

In summary, these tools each serve specific cryptographic needs: OpenSSH for secure remote access, GPG for encryption and authentication, and OpenSSL as a comprehensive cryptographic library for implementing secure communication protocols and operations.

Creating private and public keys using openssl and ssh-keygen

openssl genrsa -out MyPrivateKey 4096
openssl rsa -in MyPrivateKey -pubout -out MyPublicKey

This creates a private RSA key and then derives the public key from it,

ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa -f MyFancyKey

This creates a private RSA key in the file 'MyFancyKey' and the corresponding public key in 'MyFancyKey.pub'.


The structure for the private keys seems somewhat similar, although the one created with openssl begins with:
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

And the one from ssh-keygen begins with:
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----


the corresponding public keys, the one from openssl contains:

-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
  ...base64 encoded...
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

While the one from ssh-keygen just contains one line:
ssh-rsa XXXXXX...base64 encoded...XXXXX Rocketnuts@Rocketnuts-MBP.my.networkname


is there a fundamental difference between these two kinds of keys?

No, they're essentially the same data.

BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY indicates "PKCS#1" or "PEM" key format, which is Base64 encoding of an ASN.1 DER serialized structure. 
It's a basic ASN.1 sequence containing the RSA parameters (n, e, d, p, q, etc).

Note: ASN.1 DER refers to Abstract Syntax Notation defined by RFC 5280 (for X.509) whose serialization format is DER (Distinguished
encoding rules). ASN is similar to protobuf (language agnostic way of encoding objects)

This format comes from the PEM email security effort that later became S/MIME (hence the usage of ASN.1 DER) and was commonly used 
for SSL/TLS as well as miscellaneous generic RSA.

For a long time, it was also OpenSSH's primary key format (because OpenSSH already uses OpenSSL's cryptographic code, 
so the "load key" and "write key" functions were also conveniently available). 
This means you can use ssh-keygen -m PEM to generate or convert such keys.

BEGIN PRIVATE KEY indicates "PKCS#8" key format (unencrypted); it'the contents are very similar to the PEM format,
with the same RSA parameters nested inside another structure that indicates that it is indeed an RSA key.

PKCS#8 is specifically meant as the more modern replacement of the PEM format. Compared to PEM, the PKCS#8 format more 
cleanly separates the "payload" (key algorithm, encryption) from the outer Base64 wrapper – all metadata is now inside the structure, 
so it's easier to update for new key types. The new format also supports better ciphers and KDFs for encrypted keys.

OpenSSH will recognize this format too (due to its OpenSSL usage for key loading), and I think recent versions are also able to create it.

BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY is a format invented by OpenSSH for OpenSSH, and unlike the PEM/PKCS formats, 
it uses SSHv2 packet serialization for its data structures (no more DER or ASN.1).

One reason OpenSSH now uses this format so that it could avoid depending on OpenSSL entirely, and/or so that it could add new 
key algorithms without waiting for OpenSSL to implement loading/saving of those keys – which also means waiting for PKIX to 
standardize the ASN.1 OID and structure for each new algorithm (which otherwise has absolutely nothing to do with SSH).

For example, it took a while for OpenSSL to gain full Ed25519 support, during which time OpenSSH could neither use OpenSSL's libcrypto 
for the actual math, nor for loading/saving Ed25519 key files – that's what prompted the creation of this format.

Another advantage of the OpenSSH format is that passphrase-encrypted keys use bcrypt for the encryption key derivation; 
at the time the PEM format was limited to a very weak (i.e. easy to bruteforce) KDF, and even PKCS#8 supports only the slightly inferior PKBDF2.

As for the PUBLIC key format, 

BEGIN PUBLIC KEY is, I believe, also PKCS#8 – so inside Base64 there's a DER-serialized ASN.1 structure which identifies it as an RSA key, 
followed by key parameters (n, e).

The one-line format is partially OpenSSH-specific, although the central Base64-encoded data is in exactly the same format as used within 
the SSHv2 protocol itself ("on the wire"). As you might guess, the encoded data uses SSHv2 packet serialization – but it still holds the same RSA n and e values.
