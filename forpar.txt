Complete Example

* Plug in the USB drive
* Identify the block device
$ lsblk -e7
	or
$ sudo lshw -class disk -short

sdb
|___ sdb1

* We see that the drive already has a partition. Let's format the drive 
* first unmount the filesystem in the partition
$ sudo umount /dev/sdb1
* Erase everything in the drive
$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=4M status=progress & sync
* It will pretend to be stuck just wait for some time. You may get an output like below
~~~
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=4k && sync
dd: error writing '/dev/sdb': No space left on device

1984257+0 records in
1984256+0 records out
8127512576 bytes (8.1 GB) copied, 1236.37 s, 6.6 MB/s
~~~
* The device is formatted.

* Now let's create a partition and mount a filesystem on it using parted.

* sudo parted /dev/sdb
(parted)print


(parted)mklabel msdos 		# Note use gpt in place of msdos for uefi

(parted)mkpart primary fat32 1MiB 100%

(parted)print
(parted)q

* Now mount a filesystem into the partition
$ sudo mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sdb1

* That's it. We have created a partition and mounted a file system into it. 

* To power off the usb drive 
$ sudo udisksctl unmount -b /dev/sdb1
$ sudo udisksctl power-off -b /dev/sdb
