Useful commands
---------------
pwd -- Will display the present working directory

file <filename>	--> Will print the details about file
less <filename>  --> Will scroll through a file

cd <dirname> | cd ~ (home dir) | cd <blank> (home dir) | cd .. (parent dir) |
cd - (changes from present to previous working directory) 

du --> size of disk usage by files/directories
ex: du -sh var/ --> 8.5G /var   
  du -sh asterix.pdf --> 1.2M asterix.pdf  (-s summarize)
  du -ch ~/Desktop --> 43M total (-c total )

ls --> list files/dirs in the current folder 
for ex: if we are inside ~/Desktop, then ls lists all the files/directories inside ~/Desktop

Note: 
	. (indicates the current directory)
	.. (indicates the parent directory)

ls * --> will list files and directories(including contents) in the current directory.
Note:
* wildcard matches any number of characters
if we are inside ~/Desktop, then * will match names of all files and directories inside ~/Desktop.
ls * will take these names and will pass them as arguments to ls. 
for ex:  ls one-tab.txt golang React. so ls will list one-tab.txt and also the contents of golang and React folders. 

ls */ --> will list only dirs(and contents) but not files. 

ls -l --> Long mode, get more details rather than just file/dir names (By default all are sorted by name)
ls -al --> all files (including hidden) and directories in current dir in long mode
ls -Al --> almost all files (except curdir and pardir) in long mode
ls -lR --> list all files/dirs along with their contents (files/dirs) recursively 
ls -lR <dir> --> list contents of dir and sub-directories of the mentioned folder recursively.

ls -d --> list details
ls -ld  -->  list long mode details. 
ls -ld <dir> -->  list details of directory without content.
ex: ls -ld ~/Desktop --> drwxr-xr-x 9 mordor mordor 4096 Mar  8 18:08 /home/mordor/Desktop

ls -ld * -->  will just display details of files/dirs inside current folder (but not contents)
ls -ld */ --> lists details of all the directories in the current folder.(but not contents)
ls -ld Revision/*  --> lists details of all the files/directories (not contents) in the Revision folder
ls -ld Revision/*/ --> lists details of all the directories in the Revision folder. (but not contents)
           
ls -lF --> classify directory with / at the end or * for files
ls -lh --> human readable file size (K,M,G)
ls -lt --> list files in recent modification time order
ls -lS --> list files in order of size
ls -lSh --> list files in order of size in human readable (K,M,G)
ls -r --> reverse anything 
for ex: ls -lr (reverse name order), ls -lrt (reverse modification time order, old first), ls -lrS --> reverse size order

mkdir dir1 dir2 dir2 --> makes directories
mkdir -p dir1/subdir1/subsubdir1 --> creates all the directories in the path.

cp --> copy command

cp item1 item2 item3.... dir -> copies item<x> files into dir

cp item1 item2 --> in case of files (copies contents from item1 to item2, if item2 doesn't exist it is created)

cp -r item1/ item2 or cp -r item1 item2
--> if item2 exists, copies item1 and its contents recursively into item2. (item1 becomes sub directory of item2)
--> else item2 is created and contents of item1 are copied into item2. (basically a replica of item1 with the name item2)

cp -r item/* item2 -> content of item1 including sub-directories (recursively) is copied into item2 (item2 directory should exist otherwise error)

cp item1/* item2 -> files (not directories) inside item1 is copied into item2 (item2 directory should exist otherwise error)

cp -i (interactive option, will prompt the user if the file is being overwritten)
cp -u (copy only those whose modification time is newer)


mv --> move command, similar to cp, except the source is deleted
mv item1 item2 item3.... dir -> moves item<x> files into dir

mv item1 item2 --> in case of files if file exists copies contents from item1 to item2 and deletes item1, if item2 doesn't exist 
item1 is renamed as item2.

In case of directories, (we don't use -r as in cp)

mv item1 item2 or mv item1/ item2
-> if item2 exists, moves item1 and its contents recursively into item2.
-> else item1 is renamed item2

mv item1/* item2 -> content of item1 is moved into item2 (item2 directory should exist otherwise error)

rm --> remove

rm item1 item2 ... -> removes files item<x>...
rm -r dir 
   or	-> removes dir and its contents
rm -r dir/

rm -r dir/* -> removes all the contents of dir without deleting dir

remember rm cannot be undone, so it's wise to set alias rm='rm -i' so that we are prompted before deleting anything.

rm -rf --> force deletion

ln -s item link --> create symbolic link to the item
ex: ln -s ~/devide/nvim.appimage /usr/local/bin/vim


Commands can be executables, shell builtins, shell functions and an alias (command that is built from other commands)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
type --> to find out the type of a command
ex: type cd (shell builtin), type ls (alias for ls --color=auto), type cp (command /usr/bin/cp) --> executable

sometimes there are more than one version of a executable. to know which one we are
using we use the "which" . this only works for executables, not shell built-ins or aliases
ex: which python3

help --> use help command for getting help about shell builtins, for ex: help cd 

for executables, try using --help, it will work for most of the commands
ex: cp --help

most executables intended for command line provide a manual called man page. you can
find the man page of an executable by typing
man <executable>
for ex: type find --> /usr/bin/find (so executable)
	man find

creating alias --> ex: alias foo='cd /usr; ls; cd -'

cat --> reads from stdin and write it to stdout, if no file is specified. 
ex: cat <enter> i.e blank line will produce one more line
(Note: eof -- ctrl-d in linux or ctrl+z in windows marks end of stdin)

cat file.... ---> reads from files and writes to stdout
ex: if we have movie.mpeg01, movie.mpeg02..... then we can concatenate it all by
cat movie.mpeg0* > movie.mpeg since wildcard expands in sorted order it will work

cat -A --> shows everything including newline as $ and tab as ^I
ex: cat -A one_tab.txt --> will print the contents to stdout that includes newlines ($), space and tab (^I) characters

cat < test.txt --> redirects source of stdin from keyboard to test.txt (the file will not be passed as argument, so cat will
read the contents from stdin which the shell has set to the contents of test.txt)

Pipeline | --> the standard output of one command is piped into the standard input of another
ex: cat test.txt | wc -l 

wc –-> Print Line, Word, and Byte Counts 
ex: wc ls-output.txt --> 7902 64566 503634 ls-output.txt
wc -l for only line count, wc -c for byte count and wc -w for word count

sort f1 -> sorts a file and prints to stdout
sort f1 f2 --> concatenates file contents, sorts the lines, and prints to stdout

when no file or '-' then read from stdin for ex: 
$ sort
hello
there
must
be
some
mistake
<eof> (ctrl-d)

be
hello
mistake
must
some
there

uniq --> used in conjunction with sort.. it accepts a sorted list of data from stdin or a single file and removes duplicates 
and writes it to stdout or other o/p
ex: sort - | uniq
hello
hello
there
there
must
must
mistake
<eof> ctrl-d

hello
mistake
must
there

ex: ls /bin /usr/bin | sort | uniq | wc -l
2728 (lines)

head or tail –-> Print First or Last Part of Files
ex: head -n 5 ls-output.txt  or tail -n 5 ls-output.txt
ls /usr/bin | tail -n 5

use -f or --follow option to show real-time changing output of a file
tail -f /var/log/auth.log

tee –-> The tee program reads standard input and copies it to both standard output (allowing the data to continue down the pipeline) and to one or more files.
ex: ls /usr/bin | tee ls.txt | grep zip
Here tee captures the entire directory listing to the file ls.txt before grep filters the pipeline's contents:

xargs --> it reads input from stdin or file and converts them into arguments to a command
ex: find /path -type f -print | xargs rm    --> takes filenames and passes it as arguments to the rm command

from stdin: This becomes echo hello this is narayan 
$  xargs echo
hello this is narayan
--> hello this is narayan
----------------------------

Redirection
------------
#### Redirection 

**Redirecting input**
`[n]<word`
* This causes the file denoted by the word to be opened for reading on file descriptor n.
* If n is not specified then stdin (fd 0) is assumed.

Ex:
cat < sample.txt - sample.txt is opened for reading using stdin, same as cat 0< sample.txt
exec 10< sample.txt - sample.txt is opened for reading and fd 10 is associated with it

**Redirecting output**
`[n]>word`
* This causes the file denoted by word to be opened for writing on file descriptor n.
* If n is not specified then stdout (fd 1) is assumed. File is created if it doesn't exist.

Ex:
ls > sample.txt - sample.txt is opened (or created) for writing using stdout, same as ls 1> sample.txt 
exec 10> sample.txt - sample.txt is opened (or created) for writing and fd 10 is associated with it

**Appending Redirected output**
`[n]>>word`
* This causes the file denoted by word to be opened for appending on file descriptor n.
* If n is not specified then stdout (fd 1) is assumed. File is created if it doesn't exist.

ls >> sample.txt - sample.txt is opened (or created) for appending using stdout, same as ls 1>> sample.txt
exec 10>> sample.txt - sample.txt is opened (or created) for appending and fd 10 is associated with it

**Duplicating File Descriptors**
`[n]<&word`
* This is used to duplicate input file descriptors. 
* The fd denoted by n is made a copy of the fd denoted by the word. If n is not specified then stdin (fd 0) is used.

Ex:
`exec 10<&0` --> fd 10 is a copy of the fd 0 (stdin). So reading from 10 is similar to reading from stdin

`[n]>&word`
* This is used to duplicate output file descriptors.
* The fd denoted by n is made a copy of the fd denoted by the word. If n is not specified then stdout (fd 1) is used.

Ex:
exec 2>&1 --> fd 2 is a copy of fd 1 (stdout). So writing to 2 is similar to writing to stdout. 

**Closing File Descriptors**
`[n]<&-`
* Close file descriptor n or stdin (fd 0) if n is not specified

Ex:
`exec 6< bar.txt` -- Open bar.txt for reading through fd 6
`exec 6<&-` -- Close file descriptor 6
We can alose close stdout (fd 1) and stderr (fd 2)
`exec 0<&-`
`exec 2<&-`

**Redirecting stdout and stderr**
`&>word` and it is semantically equivalent to `>word 2>&1`
* This causes stdout and stderr to be redirected to the file denoted by the word.

Ex:
ls /bin/usr &> /dev/null
ls /bin/usr > /dev/null 2>&1

**Appending stdout and stderr
`&>>word` and it is semantically equivalent to `>>word 2>&1`
* This causes stdout and stderr to be appended to the file denoted by the word.

Ex:
ls /bin/usr &>> /dev/null
ls /bin/usr >> /dev/null 2>&1


**Moving File Descriptors**
`[n]<&digit-`  -- Moving input file descriptor
* moves file descriptor digit to file descriptor n, or stdin (fd 0) if n is not specified.
* digit is closed after being duplicated to n. 

Ex:
~~~bash
$ echo "hello world" > foo.txt
$ exec 6< foo.txt
$ read input <& 6 && echo "${input}"
hello world
$ exec 7<&6-
$ read input <& 6 && echo "${input}"
bash: 6: Bad file descriptor
$ read input <& 7 && echo "${input}"
hello world
~~~
n the above code snippet, we see that once file descriptor 6 has been moved to 7, one can no longer 
access input from the file foo.txt using fd 6. However, one can access input from the file using fd 7.

`[n]>&digit-` -- Moving output file descriptor
* moves file descriptor digit to file descriptor n, or stdout if n is not not specified.
* digit is closed after being duplicated to n.

~~~bash
$ touch foo.txt
$ exec 6> foo.txt
$ echo "hello, world"  >& 6
$ cat foo.txt
hello, world
$ echo "bye, world"  >& 6
$ cat foo.txt
hello, world
bye, world
$ exec 8>&6-
$ echo "hello again, world"  >& 6
bash: 6: Bad file descriptor
$ echo "hello again, world"  >& 8
$ cat foo.txt
hello, world
bye, world
hello again, world
~~~
In the above snippet, we first assign fd 6 to file foo.txt for output. We can then redirect output to fd 6 instead
of specifying the file by name. Next, we move fd 6 to fd 8, after which we can no longer use fd 6 to refer to the 
file for output redirection. However, we can use fd 8 for output redirection.

**Opening File descriptors for reading and writing**
`[n]<>word`
* This causes the file denoted by the word to be opened for both reading and writing on the descriptor n or on fd 0 if n is not specified. 
* If the file doesn't exist, it is created.

**Here Documents and Here strings**
The format of Here documents is:
```
[n]<<[-]word
        here-document
delimiter
```
Ex:
Suppose we need to send several commands over ssh, like
	ssh -T baeldung@example.com "touch log1.txt"
	ssh -T baeldung@example.com "touch log2.txt"

However, if we’ve more commands to execute, the solution above will become cluttered and verbose. To make it more succinct, 
we can replace it with a heredoc:

	ssh -T baeldung@host.com << EOF
	touch log1.txt
	touch log2.txt
	EOF

Ex:
	cat << EOF
	This is line1
	Another line
	Finally 3rd line
	EOF

The format of Here strings is:
```
[n]<<< word
```

Ex:
	COMMAND <<< $VAR
	What it essentially does is expanding the variable _VAR_ and fed to the stdinr of the _COMMAND_

WELCOME_MESSAGE="Welcome to dashboard"
cat <<< $WELCOME_MESSAGE

cat <<< "This is a string"
